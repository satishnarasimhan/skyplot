# Skyplot
For space enthusiasts interested in spotting planets, skyplot maps out the objects in the sky for any location using NASAâ€™s SPICE system. This standalone program can be run for any location and any timezone

Hat tip to Thomas Albin for his work on the SPICE tutorials and videos, especially those related to computing and plotting the maps https://www.reddit.com/user/MrAstroThomas)
